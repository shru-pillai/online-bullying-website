    <h2>My Opinion</h2>
    <p>Online bullying is a serious problem that silently hurts many people, especially teenagers. I believe every school should teach students about digital responsibility. If we create awareness and show more kindness online, we can stop this negativity and make the internet a safer space for everyone.</p>
